    <p>
      Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most widespread and dominant species on
      Earth. We are primates characterized by bipedalism, large brains, and
      complex social structures. Our ability for abstract thought, language, and
      tool use sets us apart from other animals. We are capable of creating art,
      music, and technology. We have spread across the globe, adapting to
      diverse environments and building complex societies. However, our
      activities have also significantly impacted the planet, leading to
      environmental concerns.
